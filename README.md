# elevator-sim
Bluestaq coding challenge

This code simulates an elevator using python code. The readme is written to document some notes on my work.

1. Elevators should go up and down based on how many floors there are.
2. Elevators have a maximum capacity on people and weight.
3. Elevators should have the floors capped until more floors are built. 
4. Elevators have a button on each floor in order to get it to come to a user.
5. Elevators should have an open or close button for the doors.
6. Elevators should have some sort of emergency contact in case it malfunctions.

Elevator Class:
